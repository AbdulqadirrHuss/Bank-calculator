This was made with React and has Material UI and has the useState React hooks. The most difficult part was getting a functional Principal and Interest component and I had to go through a lot of tutorials and stack overflow for {e.target.value}. After that it was pretty easy and I used the formula   A = P(1 + r/n) (nt)  for the calculate button.
